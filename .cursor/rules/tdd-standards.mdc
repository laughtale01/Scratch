# Cursor TDD Standards

## MANDATORY TDD WORKFLOW
1. ALWAYS write tests BEFORE implementation
2. ALWAYS verify tests fail before implementing
3. ALWAYS run all tests after changes
4. NEVER skip the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle

## Test Writing Rules
- WRITE test description before test code
- CREATE mocks/stubs before real implementation
- TEST edge cases and error conditions
- INCLUDE regression tests for bug fixes

## Test Execution
- RUN tests before EVERY commit
- VERIFY 100% pass rate before proceeding
- CHECK coverage meets minimum requirements
- FIX failing tests immediately

## Regression Prevention
- IDENTIFY all potentially affected code
- WRITE tests for existing functionality
- VERIFY no behavior changes
- DOCUMENT what should NOT change

## Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Tests written before implementation?
- [ ] All tests passing?
- [ ] Edge cases covered?
- [ ] No regression in existing features?
- [ ] Coverage meets requirements?
